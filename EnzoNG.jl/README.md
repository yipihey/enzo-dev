Next-generation Enzo: a shared-memory AMR astrophysics code with **orchestration in Julia** and a small, stable kernel surface, built on a **swappable AMR substrate behind one interface**. See [`docs/adr/0001-architecture.md`](docs/adr/0001-architecture.md) for the full architecture decision record.

## Overview

EnzoNG.jl is a modern astrophysics simulation framework that provides:

- **Shared-memory AMR**: Adaptive mesh refinement for efficient computation
- **Julia orchestration**: High-level control and flexibility using Julia
- **Swappable backends**: Multiple computational backends behind a single interface
- **Conservative finite-volume methods**: Accurate physical simulations

This repository runs an end-to-end finite-volume hydro stack (spec → mesh → fields → kernel → BC → flux-divergence update → conservation check) on **two interchangeable backends** behind one interface: a pure-Julia reference (`RefMesh`) and an adapter over [HierarchicalGrids.jl](https://github.com/) (`HGBackend`). The same solver, problem spec, and driver run unchanged on both.

## Key Features

- **Sod shock tube** on both backends, matched to the exact Riemann solution, with a cross-backend agreement test proving identical physics (P2 oracle)
- **Hierarchical AMR** on `HGBackend`: a Julia refinement policy drives dynamic regridding; the substrate conservatively remaps fields on refine and enumerates coarse↔fine **hanging-node** sub-faces, so the flux-divergence scheme stays conservative across level jumps. Validated by conservation to round-off and by convergence against a uniform-fine `RefMesh` oracle
- **2D Sedov–Taylor blast**: dynamic AMR tracks the expanding circular shock (base 48² → ~4.8k leaves), preserving mass/energy to round-off and four-fold symmetry, with shock growth ≈ the self-similar R ∝ t^{1/2} law

## The multi-code framework

Beyond the native stack, EnzoNG.jl is the umbrella of a **federated multi-code
framework** (ADR-0006): live Enzo, mini-RAMSES, Arepo, Athena++, GADGET-4,
MUSIC, DISCO-DJ, and dfmm all drive through one Julia session — shared ICs,
cross-code comparison gates against exact solutions, and mix-and-match guest
slots (PPMKernels hydro and KA Poisson inside RAMSES, RAMSES-RT inside Enzo,
Moray inside Arepo) certified to solver tolerance. The complete registry of
wrappers, kernel libraries, and certified capabilities is
[`docs/framework-surface.md`](docs/framework-surface.md); the architecture and
per-phase status record is
[`docs/adr/0006-unified-multicode-framework.md`](docs/adr/0006-unified-multicode-framework.md);
the already-scoped directions beyond it are the
[`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md).

## Architecture

### The Seam is Ghost-Free and Neighbor-Driven

The substrate interface (`AbstractMeshBackend`) is shaped by the operations a finite-volume solver performs on an AMR mesh, not by any one backend's storage. A cell is an **opaque handle**; there are **no ghost cells** in the interface. Boundaries are resolved per face by `neighbor(backend, cell, axis, side; bcs)`, which returns either an interior neighbor (including a periodic wrap) or a `DomainBoundary` carrying the BC the solver applies. This is exactly the model a hierarchical, hanging-node mesh exposes, and it degenerates correctly to a uniform grid — which is why one solver runs on both `RefMesh` and the HierarchicalGrids.jl tree.

### Project Layout

```
lib/MeshInterface   The seam. AbstractMeshBackend: handle-based topology,
                    integer-exact derived geometry, neighbor-with-BC resolution,
                    layout-parametric cell-average fields, conservative
                    restrict/prolong, and the Instrumented{B} measurement
                    wrapper (P10). No implementations.

lib/RefMesh         Small, correct, pure-Julia reference backend + oracle.
                    Uniform mesh, SoA/AoS/Blocked field storage, conservative
                    2:1 restrict/prolong.

lib/HGBackend       Thin adapter implementing the seam on HierarchicalGrids.jl
                    (the architecture's target substrate). Uniform for this
                    milestone; validated test-for-test against RefMesh.

src/                The science layer (depends on MeshInterface ONLY — never on a
                    concrete backend; this is what enforces the seam). HLLC
                    Riemann solver, PLM/minmod reconstruction, ideal-gas EOS, a
                    ghost-free conservative flux-divergence driver with SSP-RK2,
                    the Problem type (a problem is source code, not a parameter
                    file), diagnostics, and an exact Riemann solver (the oracle).

problems/           Problem specs as source code (ADR P9).
test/               Interface conformance (run on both backends), Sod-vs-exact,
                    layout swap, instrumentation, and cross-backend agreement.
```

The seam is enforced by package boundaries: solver/spec/driver code cannot name a concrete backend (a direct call would be a missing-import compile error). The backend is injected at the `Simulation` constructor.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Julia 1.10+ (developed on 1.12 via `juliaup`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/enzo-project/enzo-dev.git
cd enzo-dev

# Activate the project
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

### Running Tests

```bash
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
```

### Interactive Usage

#### Using RefMesh backend:
```julia
using EnzoNG
prob = sod_problem_defaults(n = 256)

using RefMesh                       # reference backend
sim = Simulation(UniformMesh(prob.dims, prob.domain), prob)
evolve!(sim; verbose = true)
d = dump_fields(sim)                # primitive fields + coordinates (1D), sorted
```

#### Using HGBackend (HierarchicalGrids.jl):
```julia
using EnzoNG
prob = sod_problem_defaults(n = 256)

using HGBackend                     # HierarchicalGrids.jl backend
sim = Simulation(HGMesh(prob.dims, prob.domain), prob)
evolve!(sim; verbose = true)
d = dump_fields(sim)                # primitive fields + coordinates (1D), sorted
```

### Adaptive Run Example

```julia
using EnzoNG, HGBackend
include("problems/sedov_blast.jl")
prob = sedov_problem(n = 48, tfinal = 0.04)
sim  = Simulation(HGMesh(prob.dims, prob.domain), prob)
policy = RefinementPolicy(refine_above = 0.2, max_level = 2, every = 4)
evolve!(sim; policy = policy, verbose = true)   # mesh follows the expanding shock
```

## Status & Next Steps

Hydro is a correct reference on two backends, and **hierarchical AMR works on the HierarchicalGrids.jl substrate** (dynamic regridding, conservative remap, hanging nodes), validated by conservation and by convergence against the uniform `RefMesh` oracle, with the 2D Sedov blast as the dynamic-AMR demonstration.

Next, per the ADR:
- An MHD constrained-transport spike (highest risk; HG already exposes face/edge adjacency)
- Self-gravity, cooling, and cosmology until the classic Enzo suite passes
- Then Rust/GPU backends added only where the instrumented measurements justify
- Visualization/analysis are first-class and in-situ (P11)
