# ADR-0003 part B: conservative `:julia` hydro under Enzo AMR (the SubgridFluxes
# bridge). A :julia hydro slot (EnzoNG's driver on the live grid) is made
# conservative across coarse–fine boundaries by writing EnzoNG's recorded face
# fluxes into Enzo's flux registers, so Enzo's own UpdateFromFinerGrids /
# CorrectForRefinedFluxes restore conservation — the same machinery, EnzoNG's
# numbers. Two flux sets are filled (exactly what SolveHydroEquations fills):
#   • each grid's BoundaryFluxes  = the RefinedFluxes a finer grid carried, and
#   • the parent's SubgridFluxesEstimate[level][i][sub] = the coarse InitialFluxes.
#
# The DECISIVE gate (per the ADR): a refined Sod whose waves stay interior (no
# boundary outflow) conserves total mass/energy to ~round-off WITH the flux
# correction, and drifts to ~1e-3 (the documented reflux signature) WITHOUT it.
# `test_reflux.jl` (EnzoNG's native composite reflux) is the template.
#
# Guarded on grid_available() (needs the Session bridge library).
