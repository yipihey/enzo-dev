    MultiCode

The cross-code layer of ADR-0006 (D3): a **canonical state** no code owns, the
per-code `extract`/`inject!` adapters that convert at the boundary, the
conservation ledger that gates every conversion, and the comparison harness
that runs ONE problem spec through Enzo, RAMSES, and Arepo and writes one
report.

The canonical representation is deliberately minimal: cell centers, volumes,
and the conserved gas state (ρ, ρu, E) as plain `Float64` arrays in **common
normalized units** (box length = 1, with each adapter recording the scales it
divided out).  Nothing downstream of an adapter ever sees a code's internal
units or memory layout — the convert-at-the-boundary rule.

Phase-2 scope: the adapters address each code's *native* uniform-resolution
state (Enzo unigrid root, one RAMSES level, Arepo's Voronoi cell set).  AMR
composites and the R3D Voronoi↔AMR remap operators are Phase 4 (ADR-0006).

This package depends on all three wrappers directly; converting those to
package extensions (weak deps) is deferred polish — the seams are already
per-code modules.

the dual-frame moment method advances the SAME Riemann problem the legacy

This is the Athena adapter surface used by hierarchy owners: they rasterize
their blocks to the canonical layout at the boundary, and this extension owns

Boot a LIVE Enzo hydro cosmology grid directly from NATIVE CICASS HDF5 ICs (a

template): the realization's gas density/velocity and DM particle position/velocity
are written to Enzo's IC datasets in code units, with the cosmology (Ωb, Ωcdm, Ωr,
