# The EQUATION SET — the swappable physics/variable model (ADR: physics is data).
#
# EnzoNG's conservative finite-volume driver (flux accumulation, SSP-RK2,
# refluxing) is generic over the *equation set*: it asks the model for the
# variable count, the conserved-field names, the role indices (which components
# are density / momentum / energy — for gravity & cosmology source terms), and
# the physics kernels (cons2prim/prim2cons/sound_speed/Riemann flux). The choice
# of hydro variables is therefore a value, not a hardcoded global — so MHD
# (+B,+φ), dual-energy (+gas energy), multispecies (+chemistry), or a different
# primitive/energy formulation are new `EquationSet`s, not core surgery.
#
# `IdealHydro` is the default and reproduces the prior 5-variable ideal-gas core
# bit-for-bit. The variable count is a static (`nvars`), so conserved tuples are
# built `Val`-sized and the driver stays type-stable.

"""
    EquationSet

Supertype of every physics/variable model. A model declares its conserved
variable count and names, the role indices used by source terms, and the
hydro kernels. Implement the generic functions below for a new equation set.

Adiabatic ideal-gas hydrodynamics. Conserved `(ρ, ρvx, ρvy, ρvz, E)`, primitive
