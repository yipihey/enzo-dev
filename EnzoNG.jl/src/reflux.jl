# Coarse–fine flux refluxing for AMR time subcycling (ADR P5: the solver builds
# refluxing on the substrate's conservative transfer). On EnzoNG's composite
# (leaf-only) mesh there is no coarse-under-fine cell to "project down"; instead
# we correct the *coarse leaf adjacent to a refinement boundary* so that the flux
# it saw over its big step equals the time-integrated flux the fine leaves on the
# other side actually carried over their substeps. This is the modern
# flux-register form of Enzo's `UpdateFromFinerGrids.C` /
# `Grid_CorrectForRefinedFluxes.C`, and it restores exact conservation across the
# interface that subcycling otherwise breaks (the two sides advance with
# different dt).
#
# Mechanics. A `FluxRegister` accumulates, per (coarse leaf, conserved component),
# the signed flux mismatch in *conserved units already divided by nothing* — i.e.
# the same `flux·area·dt` quantity the state update consumes as `acc·dt/V` (so the
# correction is `register / V_coarse`, applied once after the fine level finishes
# its subcycles). Sign convention matches `_flux_face!`: across a face with +axis
# normal pointing left→right, the flux `F·area` *leaves* the left cell and
# *enters* the right.
#
#   • Coarse step over dt_c: for each coarse↔fine face touching coarse cell `c`,
#     subtract the coarse flux contribution to `c` (we will replace it):
#       register[c] -= sign_c · F_coarse · area_fine · dt_c
#   • Each fine substep over dt_f: add the fine flux contribution that crossed
#     the same physical interface:
#       register[c] += sign_c · F_fine · area_fine · dt_f
#     (sign_c is +1 if `c` is the left/low side of the face, −1 if the right/high
#     side — i.e. whether the +axis normal points out of or into `c`.)
#   • After the fine level's subcycles complete, apply:
#       U[c] += register[c] / V_coarse ;  register[c] = 0
#
# The fine `area_fine` is exactly what `for_each_face` already passes (it emits
# coarse↔fine sub-faces carrying the fine area), and summing the fine sub-faces
# over a coarse face reconstructs the coarse face area, so the registers balance
# to round-off. Because flux capture happens inside the SSP-RK2 stages, we record
# the RK2-averaged face flux (½ stage-1 + ½ stage-2), matching the actual update.

    FluxRegister

Per-coarse-leaf accumulator of the signed coarse↔fine flux mismatch (in
flux·area·time units). Keyed by coarse cell handle; value is an `NTuple{NVAR}`.
Created per coarse–fine level pair for the duration of one coarse step.

`coarse_level` selects which interfaces to capture (the `(coarse_level,
coarse_level+1)` jump). `scale` is set by the driver before each capture pass: it
folds the signed timestep and the RK-stage weight together — `−½·dt_c` on each of
the coarse step's two RK stages, `+½·dt_f` on each fine substep's two stages — so
the register ends a coarse step holding `Σ(fine flux·dt_f) − (coarse flux·dt_c)`
in net-flux-out units, ready to apply as `U_coarse −= register / V_coarse`.

# ── ND face-plane raster (ADR-0003 follow-up #2) ──────────────────────────────
# Enzo stores a coarse–fine face flux as a flat plane `Left/RightFluxes[field][dim]`
# of `prod(Dim)` cells, where `Dim[d] = EndGlobalIndex[dim][d] − StartGlobalIndex
# [dim][d] + 1` and the flux dim is collapsed (Dim[dim]=1). Its consumer
# (`Grid_CorrectForRefinedFluxes.C:460`) addresses cell at global index `g` by
#   FluxIndex = Σ_d (g[d] − StartGlobalIndex[dim][d]) · Π_{e<d} Dim[e]
# i.e. column-major over the orthogonal dims, dim-0 fastest. In 1D the plane is a
# single cell; in ND it is the (D−1)-plane of the face. `bflux_plane` rasterizes
# one (dim, side) plane: it walks the plane offsets, maps each to EnzoNG's active
# CartesianIndex (1-based), looks up the recorded flux NTuple, and returns the
# `Vector{Float64}` in Enzo's units (`enzo_value = bflux/Vcell`) for component `comp`.
#
# `start`,`stop` are the length-`rank` global StartGlobalIndex/EndGlobalIndex of
# this face plane; `g0` is the grid's first-active-cell global index (length-rank).
# `flux_off` is the active-index offset along the flux dim itself: the orthogonal
# dims map straight (`a = g − g0 + 1`), but the flux-dim register key follows the
# verified 1D mapping (Left subgrid face → lo cell `g − g0`, Right → `g − g0 + 1`;
# own outer boundary → the boundary cell directly), supplied by the caller.
# `lookup(I)` returns the recorded flux for active cell `I`, or `nothing` (⇒ 0).
